Welcome to quantcore.glm's documentation!
===========================================

`quantcore.glm` is a fast, Python-first GLM library. In addition to fitting basic GLMs, it supports a wide range of features. These include:

* Built-in cross validation for optimal regularization, efficiently exploiting a “regularization path”
* L1 regularization, which produces sparse and easily interpretable solutions
* L2 regularization, including variable matrix-valued (Tikhonov) penalties, which are useful in modeling correlated effects
* Elastic net regularization
* Normal, Poisson, logistic, gamma, and Tweedie distributions, plus varied and customizable link functions
* Box constraints, sample weights, offsets.
