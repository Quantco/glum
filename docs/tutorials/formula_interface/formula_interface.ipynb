    "# Formula Interface Tutorial: Revisiting French Motor Third-Party Liability Claims\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intro**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases the formula interface of `glum`. It allows for the specification of the design matrix and the response variable using so-called [Wilkinson-formulas](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346786) instead of constructing it by hand. This kind of model specification should be familiar to R users or those who have used the `statsmodels` or `linearmodels` Python packages before. This tutorial aims to introduce the basics of working with formulas to other users, as well as highlighting some important differences between `glum`s and other packages' formula implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more in-depth look at how formulas work, please take a look at the [documentation of `formulaic`](https://matthewwardrop.github.io/formulaic/), the package on which `glum`'s formula interface is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial reimplements and extends the combined frequency-severity model from Chapter 4 of the [GLM tutorial](tutorials/glm_french_motor_tutorial/glm_french_motor.html). If you would like to know more about the setting, the data, or GLM modeling in general, please check that out first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sneak Peak**\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulas can provide a concise and convenient way to specify many of the usual pre-processing steps, such as converting to categorical types, creating interactions, applying transformations, or even spline interpolation. As an example, consider the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ClaimAmountCut / Exposure} ~ C(DrivAge, missing_method='convert') * C(VehPower, missing_method=\"zero\") + bs(BonusMalus, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its brevity, it describes all of the following:\n",
    " - The outcome variable is the ratio of `ClaimAmountCut` and `Exposure`.\n",
    " - The predictors should include the interactions of the categorical variables `DrivAge` and `VehPower`, as well as those two variables themselves. (Even though they behave as such, neither the individual variables nor their interaction will be dummy-encoded by glum. For categoricals with many levels, this can lead to a substantial performance improvement over dummy encoding, especially for the interaction.)\n",
    " - If there are missing values in `DrivAge`, they should be treated as a separate category.\n",
    " - On the other hand, missing values in `VehPower` should be treated as all-zero indicators.\n",
    " - The predictors should also include a third degree B-spline interpolation of `BonusMalus`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chapters demonstrate each of these features in some detail, as well as some additional advantages of using the formula interface."

    "One of the biggest strengths of Wilkinson-formuals lie in their ability of concisely specifying interactions between terms. `glum` implements this as well, and in a very efficient way: the interactions of categorical features are encoded as a new categorical feature, making it possible to interact high-cardinality categoricals with each other. If this is not possible, because, for example, a categorical is interacted with a numeric variable, sparse representations are used when appropriate. In general, just as with `glum`'s categorical handling in general, you can be assured that `glum` you don't have to worry too much about the actual implementation, and can expect that `glum` will do the most efficient thing behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how that looks like on the insurance example! Suppose that we expect `VehPower` to have a different effect depending on `DrivAge` (e.g. performance cars might not be great for new drivers, but may be less problematic for more experienced ones). We can include the interaction of these variables as follows."

This is a manifestation of the more general concept of [ensuring structural full-rankedness](https://matthewwardrop.github.io/formulaic/guides/contrasts/#guaranteeing-structural-full-rankness)<sup>4</sup>. By default, `glum` and `formulaic` will try to make sure that one does not fall into the [Dummy Variable Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)). Moreover, it even does it in the case of (possibly multi-way) interactions involving categorical variables. It will always drop the necessary number of levels, and no more. If you want to opt out of this behavior (for example because you would like to penalize all levels equally), simply set the `drop_first` parameter during model initialization to `False`. If one only aims to include all levels of a certain variable, and not others, it is possible to do so by using the `spans_intercept` parameter (e.g. `C(VehPower, spans_intercept=False)` would include all levels of `VehPower` even if `drop_first` is set to `True`).\n",

They can also be treated as if they represented all-zeros indicators (`\"zero\"` option, which is also the way `pandas.get_dummies` works) or missing values can be treated as their own separate category (`\"convert\"` option).\n",

    "Similarly to the non-formula-based interface, `glum`'s behavior can be set globally using the `cat_missing_method` parameter during model initialization. However, formulas provide some additional flexibility: the `C` function has a `missing_method` parameter, with which users can select an option on a column-by-column basis. Here is an example of doing that (although our dataset does not have any missing values, so these options have no actual effect in this case):"
